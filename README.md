CARINA-Prototype-1.2
====================
This is a push into github of the prototype for CARINA that was shown at the Senior Design
presentation. 
I (Edward Sadzewicz) will start the effort to learn how best for our team to track production, 
create our own branches, merge, look at differences and such.
